# Docker VPN LNCC

This Docker image allows you to access the LNCC VPN through a container. It comes pre-installed with `vpnc` and `ssh`.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, you can download and install Docker from the official website: [https://www.docker.com](https://www.docker.com)

## Usage

### 1. Prepare the VPN Configuration
Create two configuration files: `sdumont.conf` and `ssh-config` based on the repository templates:

```bash
cd lncc
cp vpnc/sdumont.conf.template vpnc/sdumont.conf
cp ssh/config.template ssh/config
```

**sdumont.conf**
```
IPSec gateway <GATEWAY>
IPSec ID <VPN ID>
IPSec secret <VPN SECRET>
```

**ssh-config**
```
HostName <URL LOGIN SDUMONT>
User <YOUR USERNAME>
```

Replace <GATEWAY>, <VPN ID>, <VPN SECRET>, <URL LOGIN SDUMONT> and <YOUR USERNAME> with the actual values from your LNCC VPN configuration.


### 2. Build the Docker Image

Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t vpn-lncc .
```

### 3. Run the VPN Container

Now, you can run the Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged -v ./vpnc:/etc/vpnc -v ./ssh:/home/nonroot/.ssh vpn-lncc /bin/bash
```
Make sure the mounted volumes are the `./ssh` and `./vpnc` directory where the modified ssh and vpn configuration files are located.

Once the container is running, you will be dropped into a bash shell within the container.

### 4. Access the LNCC VPN

From within the container, you can now access the LNCC VPN using the installed tools. You can use `vpnc` to establish the VPN connection:

```bash
sudo vpnc sdumont --local-port 0 --enable-weak-encryption
```

You can also use `ssh` to connect to remote servers through the VPN:

```bash
ssh sd
```

That's it! You should now be able to access the LNCC VPN through the Docker container.

**Note:** The `--privileged` flag is used to grant the container additional privileges required for VPN connectivity.

NAME
----
rail-sum-execution-time - Calculate total execution time from logs

SYNOPSIS
--------
*rail-sum-execution-time* [_log_file_]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *rail-sum-execution-time* script prints the total execution time of each
execution of some job, represented by some _log_file_ given. It relies on the
log files having a preformatted timestamp line at the beginning and at the end
of the files, representing the start end end of the job. The general format of
the timestamp line is the following:

    <date>: <event>: <description>

The precise formats that can be parsed are defined by a regular expression in
the code. In the current implementation, the date must be in ISO standard
format, the event must be ``Starting'' or ``Finished'' and the description field
must be the same in both start and finish events. An example of valid timestamp
line is the following:

    2024-09-02 21:56:22.714813: Starting: pz-compute

This line represents the starting timestamp and must be matched by an ending
one with an identical description field:

    2024-09-03 22:37:19.369830: Finished: pz-compute

The script only considers the first starting event in the file and its
corresponding finish event, ignoring all other events.

One execution time per _log_file_ is output and then a grand total is produced.
The script also accepts Unix glob expressions as inputs and will loop over the
matched files.

EXAMPLES
--------
Print the total execution time of a slurm batch job that logged its start and
finish timestamps:

    $ rail-sum-execution-time slurm-26580.out

Print the execution time of all log files in a directory and the grand total:

    $ rail-sum-execution-time dir1/*.log

Use the built-in glob expansion instead of the shell to summarize a large amount
of log files (using shell quotes to avoid shell expansion):

    $ rail-sum-execution-time 'dir1/*.log'

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
  Success.

*1*::
  Failure.

NAME
----
rail-preprocess-parquet - Preprocess raw data so that it's standardized for
rail-estimate.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*rail-preprocess-parquet* [_OPTION_]... [--] _input_ _output_dir_

*rail-preprocess-parquet* *-h*|*--help*

*rail-preprocess-parquet* *--version*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *rail-preprocess-parquet* script may be used to read input data in Apache
Parquet format containing either flux or magnitude data and transform it to a
standard format. It does the following preprocessing steps:

- Limit number of rows per file to a maximum, splitting the file if necessary.
- Generate files only with necessary columns (magnitudes, errors, optional
  object ID, optional coordinates).
- Convert infinite values to NaN.
- Convert flux to magnitude.
- Convert Apache Parquet files to HDF5.

Note: dereddening is not implemented yet (TDB).

Preprocessing is done as efficiently as possible and memory usage is limited
even with arbitrarily large files. The resulting output files are a set of
files, which are expected to be much smaller than the original file and suitable
to use with the RAIL algorithms.

The _input_ file must be an Apache Parquet file. In general there will be
multiple output files for a given input because it will be split so that the
output files have a maximum number of rows, by default 150 thousand. The output
is specified as an _output_dir_, and each output file path will be constructed
from a template in the form ``\{fname}-part\{idx}\{ext}'', where the base file
name will be built from the _output_dir_ and the _input_ file name, the index
will be a number representing one slice of the file, indexed in order, starting
from zero, and the extension, by default will be ``.hdf5''. The file extension
chosen will decide which file format will be used, according to the rules of the
RAIL libraries.

The input must have a set of columns for magnitude data and magnitude errors, or
a set of columns for flux data and flux errors, or the two sets of columns. The
magnitude columns have higher priority over the flux columns and, by default,
will be copied as is, if present. If not present, or if the *-f* flag is used,
then the flux columns will be converted to magnitude using a standardized
calculation and the resulting magnitudes will be stored in the output files. The
magnitude column names, by default, must follow the templates ``mag_\{band}''
and ``magerr_\{band}'' and the flux column names must follow the templates
``\{band}_gaap1p0Flux'' and ``\{band}_gaap1p0FluxErr'', where the bands are the
lower case letters representing the color bands ``u'', ``g'', ``r'', ``i'',
``z'' and ``y''. Other columns that will be copied if present are called, by
default, ``coord_ra'', ``coord_dec'' and ``objectId''.

Option arguments are used to modify the handling of the input file and output
files' names, maximum number of rows and magnitude column names. If multiple
options with conflicting formats appear in the command line, the initial ones
are ignored and the last ones are used. The list of options follows:

*-f*, *--flux*::
  Set this flag to prefer using flux columns from the input file, instead of
  magnitude columns. This flag is only meaningful when both flux and magnitude
  columns are present in the input file and switches the preference from just
  copying the magnitude values to calculating magnitude values from flux values.

*-r* _rows_, **--rows=**_rows_::
  Sets the maximum number of rows per output file. The default is 150000. If the
  _input_ file has more rows than this limit, it will be split into
  approximatelly equal parts, as close to this limit as possible. For example,
  using the default value, an _input_ file with 360000 rows would be split into
  three files with 120000 rows.

**--output-template=**_template_::
  Set the names of the output files. The default template is
  ``\{fname}-part\{idx}\{ext}'', where ``fname'' is constructed from the
  _output_dir_ and the _input_ file name with the file extension removed,
  ``idx'' is the 0-based slice index of the output file and ``ext'' is equal to
  ``.hdf5''. When changing this template, at least the placeholder for ``idx''
  must be present. Note that the chosen extension defines the output format,
  according to the rules of the RAIL library.

**--flux-template=**_template_::
  Set the names of the flux columns. The default template is
  ``\{band}_gaap1p0Flux''. It's ignored when magnitude columns are present in
  the _input_ file, unless the *-f* flag is used.

**--flux-error-emplate=**_template_::
  Set the names of the flux error columns. The default template is
  ``\{band}_gaap1p0FluxErr''. It's ignored when magnitude columns are present in
  the _input_ file, unless the *-f* flag is used.

**--mag-template=**_template_::
  Set the names of the magnitude columns. The default template is
  ``mag_\{band}''. The magnitude template name is used for the input columns,
  unless the *-f* flag is used, and it's also used for the names of the output
  columns.

**--mag-error-template=**_template_::
  Set the names of the magnitude error columns. The default template is
  ``magerr_\{band}''. The magnitude template name is used for the input columns,
  unless the *-f* flag is used, and it's also used for the names of the output
  columns.

**--ra=**_ra_::
  Set the name of equatorial coordinate right ascension. The default name is
  ``coord_ra''. The column with this name is copied if it exists.

**--dec=**_dec_::
  Set the name of equatorial coordinate right declination. The default name is
  ``coord_dec''. The column with this name is copied if it exists.

*-h*, *--help*::
  Show help message instead of executing an estimation.

*--version*::
  Show program version number instead of executing an estimation.

EXAMPLES
--------
Generate skinny tables for a file from the LSST DP0.2 dataset, using all the
default options (maximum 150000 rows per output file, default template names,
convert the flux columns to magnitude columns, generate HDF5 files):

    $ rail-preprocess-parquet \
            objectTable_tract_4857_DC2_2_2i_runs_DP0_2_v23_0_1_PREOPS-905_step3_28_20220306T041600Z.parq \
            dir1

Preprocess an input file with magnitude columns with a different template:

    $ rail-preprocess-parquet --mag-template={band}magnitude \
            --mag-error-template={band}error \
            input1.pq dir1

Generate output files with at most 500000 rows:

    $ rail-preprocess-parquet -r 500000 input1.pq dir1

For an input file that has both magnitude and flux columns, prefer flux columns:

    $ rail-preprocess-parquet -f mag-and-flux.pq dir1

Generate Parquet files:

    $ rail-preprocess-parquet --output-template={fname}-{idx}.pq input1.pq dir1

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::

    "After the analysis, we can conclude that the duplicates are not actual physical issues, such as real duplicated sources. Instead, the apparent duplication of the sources is a result of the survey's approach to preserving as much information as possible in the table. For example, we have data from:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both the parent and child sources, due to deblending;\n",
    "* Multiple observations of the same object in different patches, in the overlap area;\n",
    "* Multiple observations of the same object in different tracts, in the overlap area;\n",
    "* Additionally, there is information about sources that are simply simulated background noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if we want to eliminate all these illusory duplicates and focus only on deblended objects, excluding background noise, and considering a single observation of each source in a specific patch/tract, we must use the ```detect_isPrimary flag```.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information can be found at:\n",

NAME
----
hdf5-linea - Transform HDF5 file to a standard structure, used by LineA

SYNOPSIS
--------
*hdf5-linea* _input_ _output_

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *hdf5-linea* script converts the internal structure of HDF5 to structures
that follow the current practices in the LineA lab. This will typically be used
to convert from the file structure used by the DESC-LSST RAIL example files.
The following transformations are implemented:

- All datasets in the root (``/'') group.
- Magnitude template name: ``mag_\{band}''.
- Magnitude error template name: ``magerr_\{band}''.

The column name transformation follows these specific steps:

1. Remove the suffix ``_lsst'' from the name.
2. Replace the text ``mag_err'' with ``magerr''.

After copying all datasets to the root group, other groups are not included in
the output file.


EXAMPLES
--------
Convert the example DC2 validation file to the structure used by LineA (remove
the ``photometry'' group, rename ``mag_\{band}_lsst'' to ``mag_\{band}'' and
``mag_err_\{band}_lsst'' to ``magerr_\{band}'':

    $ hdf5-linea test_dc2_validation_9816.hdf5 linea_test.hdf5

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
  Success.

*1*::
  Failure.
